This repo is to document the analysis of Dennery labs single cell RNA seq experiment.
Ran scRNA-seq to characterize changes in lung cell subpopulations in mice exposed to hyperoxia (or air as control) for 3 days as neonates, with samples taken at 7 and 60 days post-exposure (`main` branch)..
There was also a sub-sample taken from the day 7 hyperoxia samples - these were positive for C12FDG which is a proxy for senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity (`senescence` branch).
